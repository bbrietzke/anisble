This is the way I prefer to setup an RPi, so your mileage may very. That should not stop you from forking the code and doing your own thing. Setup Following Ansible best practices , the project is structured with an inventories folder that contains the list of hosts that you will want to talk to. There is a work and a home option that contains the names/ips and usernames of the host machines. Also included are the various children which relates to the stacks that contain the roles that you will implement the software and configuration that will be installed. Personalization Additional directories can be added to inventories and setup similiar to home or work depending on how you want things to work or look. Commands Everything should be driven through the Makefile . make home - Create a new project. make work - Start the live-reloading docs server. make docs - Build the docs and upload them to gh-pages.
