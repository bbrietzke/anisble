### Configure which camera to use
#
# Available options are:
# - auto: tries first usb webcam, if that's not available tries raspi cam
# - usb: only tries usb webcam
# - raspi: only tries raspi cam
#
# Defaults to auto
#
camera="raspi"

### Additional options to supply to MJPG Streamer for the USB camera
#
# See https://faq.octoprint.org/mjpg-streamer-config for available options
#
# Defaults to a resolution of 640x480 px and a framerate of 10 fps
#
camera_usb_options="-r 1920x1080 -f 15"


### Additional options to supply to MJPG Streamer for the RasPi Cam
#
# See https://faq.octoprint.org/mjpg-streamer-config for available options.
#
# NOTE: Newer raspi cam modules are reporting as usb devices causing these
#       options to be ignored. Set `camera="raspi"` to avoid these issues.
#
# Defaults to 10fps
#
#camera_raspi_options="-fps 10"

# know what you are doing and what the parameters mean.
#
# Below settings are used in the mjpg-streamer call like this:
#
#   -o "output_http.so -w $camera_http_webroot $camera_http_options"
#
# Current working directory is the mjpg-streamer base directory.
#
#camera_http_webroot="./www-octopi"
